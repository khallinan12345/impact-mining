  1. New Tables
    - `profiles` - User profile information linked to auth.users
    - `projects` - Project listings with funding and KPI tracking
    - `donations` - Donation records linking users to projects
    - `stories` - Community stories with approval workflow
    - `donee_submissions` - Project submission requests
    - `page_views` - Optional analytics tracking

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on all tables
    - Add appropriate policies for each table
    - Ensure proper access control for different user roles

  3. Sample Data
    - Sample projects for demonstration
    - No user-dependent data to avoid foreign key issues
